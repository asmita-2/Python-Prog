My repository contains the implementation of the following machine learning concepts:  

1.
Batch Gradient Descent computes the gradient of the cost function with respect to the parameters of the model using the entire training dataset. It then update the parameters with the help of a parameter called the learning rate(alpha).The algorithm continues to iteratively update the parameters, gradually reducing the cost function until it converges to a minimum or reaches a predefined stopping criteria.
This implementation is shown in batch_gradient.py file.

2.
In Stochastic Gradient Descent, at each iteration, a single training example is randomly chosen from the training dataset.The gradient of the cost function with respect to the parameters of the model is computed using this randomly chosen example(s).The parameters are then updated scaled by a learning rate.This process is repeated for a fixed number of iterations or until convergence criteria are met.
This is implemented in stochastic.py file.

3.
Logistic regression is used for binary classification tasks, where the goal is to predict the probability of an instance belonging to a particular class. It models the relationship between one or more independent variables and a binary outcome using the logistic function, which maps any real-valued input to a value between 0 and 1. By fitting a logistic curve to the data, logistic regression estimates the probability of the outcome occurring.
This algorithm is implemented in logistic_regression.py file.

4.
Cross-validation is a technique used in machine learning to assess the performance and generalization ability of a model. It involves partitioning the dataset into multiple subsets, or folds, training the model on several combinations of these folds, and evaluating its performance on the remaining data.By iteratively training and testing the model on different subsets, cross-validation provides a more robust estimate of the model's performance and helps to mitigate issues such as overfitting.
This algorithm is shown in cross_validation.py file.

5.
A confusion matrix is a table that allows visualization of the performance of an algorithm. It showcases the model's ability to correctly or incorrectly classify instances into various categories. Typically used in supervised learning, it breaks down predictions into true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives. This matrix aids in assessing the accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, roc, and pr curve of a predictive model.
This is shown in confusion_matrix.py file.

6.
The kernel trick is a technique used in machine learning to implicitly map input data into a higher-dimensional space. By applying a kernel function, it computes the inner products between the data points in this higher-dimensional space without explicitly transforming them. This allows nonlinear decision boundaries to be learned efficiently in the original feature space, enhancing the model's ability to capture complex relationships in the data. The kernel trick enables SVMs to classify data that might not be linearly separable in their original space.
This is implemented in kernel_trick.py file.

7.
Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are powerful supervised learning models used for classification and regression tasks. They work by finding the optimal hyperplane that separates different classes in a high-dimensional feature space. SVMs aim to maximize the margin between the hyperplane and the nearest data points from each class, making them robust against overfitting and effective in dealing with high-dimensional data. They can handle linear and nonlinear classification tasks using various kernel functions, such as linear, polynomial, or radial basis function (RBF) kernels.
This is implemented in svm.py file.

8.
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a dimensionality reduction technique used to simplify datasets while preserving most of their original information. It works by transforming the data into a new coordinate system where the axes correspond to the principal componentsâ€”directions of maximum variance in the data. PCA identifies these components in such a way that the first component captures the most variance, followed by subsequent components. By retaining only the most significant components, PCA reduces the dataset's dimensionality, making it easier to visualize, analyze, and model while minimizing information loss.
This is implemented in pca.py file.

9.
Clustering is an unsupervised learning technique used to group similar data points together in a dataset. It aims to discover hidden patterns or structures within the data by partitioning it into distinct clusters, where data points within the same cluster are more similar to each other than those in different clusters. Common clustering algorithms include K-means and hierarchical clustering.
This is shown in clustering.py file.
